# TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn Model Training and Evaluation

## Overview

This repository includes code for training and evaluating various machine learning and deep learning models using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. The project covers:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**: Implementing and evaluating a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Building and training a CNN for image classification on CIFAR-10.
3. **Object Detection with Pretrained Models**: Using a pretrained object detection model for inference and visualization.
4. **Vision Transformer**: Implementing a Vision Transformer model and comparing its performance with other models.

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:


pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow tensorflow-addons vit-keras pycocotools
